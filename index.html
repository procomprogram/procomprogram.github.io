            The SuperTiedown is a new kind of Tiedown which responds to changes in load tension, preventing rough roads and awkward loads from loosening the strap and losing the cargo.
            Inside the steel ratchet are two heavy-industry grade steel springs which absorb additional tension when the Responsive Ratchet is tightened.  During load shift, this extra tension is transferred into the strap, 
            maintaining overall tension and preventing the strap from loosening.
